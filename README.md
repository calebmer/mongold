## A Name of Many Meanings

This package was hard to create a name for. Mongol was taken on NPM and is a package used for Meteor, so a simple '*d*' was added. This is what the it became:

- **Mongo**-ld: as in MongoDB
- Mongo-**ld**: as in Linked Data
- **Mongol**-d: as in Ghengis Khan
- Mon-**gold**: as in gold (*cha-ching*)
